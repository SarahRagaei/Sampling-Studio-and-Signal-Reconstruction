# Signal-Composer-and-Sampling-Theory-Studio

Sampling Theory Studio is a powerful desktop application designed to illustrate the concepts of **signal sampling and recovery**, emphasizing the importance and validation of the **Nyquist rate**. With its intuitive interface and comprehensive features, it allows users to load, visualize, sample, and recover analog signals seamlessly.

---

## Key Features:

### 1. Load & Compose Signals

Import signals from files or create them using the built-in signal mixer.

Add multiple sinusoidal components with customizable frequencies and magnitudes.

Remove any components dynamically to fine-tune your composed signal.

### 2. Sampling & Recovery

Load mid-length signals, visualize them, and sample at different frequencies.

Reconstruct the original signal using the **Whittaker–Shannon interpolation** formula.

Display sampling frequency in actual Hz or normalized frequency for better analysis.

### 3. Additive Noise Simulation

Add noise to signals with fully configurable Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) levels.

Visualize the effects of noise depending on the signal’s frequency content.

### 4. Real-Time Processing

All sampling, noise addition, and recovery processes update instantly as users adjust parameters.

No manual refresh is required—changes are reflected in real-time.

### 5. Adaptive & Resizable Interface

User-friendly GUI that scales smoothly with different window sizes.

Ensures consistent visualization across various resolutions.

### 6. Multiple Sampling Scenarios

SignalSampler+ includes at least three synthetic test signals generated by the Composer.

Demonstrates different sampling cases for comprehensive learning and experimentation.
